      /* ABOUT */
    "aboutme": "I'm a recent graduate of Lambda School's Fullstack program. I have a passion for anything relating to tech and science. My first introduction to tech was with hardware when I was around 12, I became pretty obsessed with learning about computer hardware and that lead me to learning about software. Although I'm very confident in my skills my philosophy is that there is always something to learn and I aim to learn it all. My goal in life is to contribute something meaningful to the world. Currently in my free time if i'm not working on a side project I am learning Quantum Physics.",
